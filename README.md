#### Check out my Java edition, [JAlgorithm](https://github.com/jljacoblo/jalgorithm)

This project
------
includes some of the algorithms I came across online  
I actively work on new Algorithms in GeeksforGeeks.org, Hackerrank.com, Topcoder.org, etc.

This solution
------
is configure into 2 CMake solutions: src and test.  
The file structure inside each solutions is the same.  
With Unit tests has a file suffix XXXTest.cpp

For src solution:
------
all algorithms is written inside header file  
This allow easy extraction of that algorithm  
All algorithms also is namespaced of its own, so no interaction between others,  
unlike normal projects.

##List of Algorithm curently have:
